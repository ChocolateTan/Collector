It didn\u2019t matter if we were trekking from Chicago to Florida or taking a scenic journey to camp at Boulder Lake in Wisconsin. We\u2019d always make a summer jams soundtrack (on cassette), pack the car full of snacks, and stick our heads out the window to feel the cool breeze.\u00a0</p><br/><p>These days, road trips feature my wife and son, as we explore all that California has to offer, but those old habits have remained the same.</p><br/><p>For many people like myself, road trips will always will be quintessential part of summer. If you\u2019re planning to hit the road for an adventure of your own, here are eight ways the Google Assistant can help you safely get things done when you\u2019re behind the wheel (or in the back seat):</p><ol><li><p>Check the weather at your destination by saying \u201cHey Google, what\u2019s the weather like in Yellowstone this weekend?\u201d</p></li><li><p>\"Hey Google, how's traffic to downtown Charlotte?\" will give you the quickest route to your destination.</p></li><li><p>Give your friends an update on your arrival time by saying, \u201cHey Google, share my ETA with Ari.\u201d\u00a0</p></li><li><p>Stay in touch while you\u2019re on the road by asking, \u201cHey Google, call Dad.\u201d\u00a0</p></li><li><p>\u201cHey Google, find the nearest gas station\u201d will help you when you need to make a pit stop. Or ask your Assistant, \u201cHey Google, where\u2019s the nearest coffee shop?\u201d when you need to get your caffeine fix.\u00a0</p></li><li><p>Avoid boredom with a podcast or audiobook while you're driving through remote locations. Just say, \u201cHey Google, play Planet Money.\u201d</p></li><li><p>Play, pause or skip through your favorite songs from services like YouTube Music, Pandora, and Spotify.\u00a0</p></li><li><p>Send text messages with your voice so you can keep your eyes on the road. Just ask the Assistant, \u201cHey Google, send a text to Jake\u201d or \u201cHey Google, read my messages.\u201d</p></li></ol><p>And it\u2019s really easy to get started.

Give it a go by saying, \u201cHey Google, show me my pictures from Yosemite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Buckle up and and remember to take plenty of pictures of your trip!</p></div></div></body></html>", "https://www.blog.google/products/assistant/8-tips-stress-free-summer-road-trip/", "2019-07-30 16:00:00", "https://www.blog.google/products/android/rss/", "2019-08-19 04:49:33", "2019-08-19 04:49:33"], [4, "With Sound Amplifier, more people can hear clearly", "https://www.blog.google/products/android/sound-amplifier-more-people-can-hear-clearly/", "<html><head></head><body><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>For the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deafness-and-hearing-loss\">466 million people in the world</a> who have hearing loss, the inability to hear a conversation or the sounds around you can be isolating. Without clear sound, it\u2019s challenging to connect to the people around you and fully experience the world. And simply asking others to speak louder (or turn up the TV volume) isn\u2019t a helpful solution because people hear more clearly at different audio frequencies.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Sound Amplifier is an Android Accessibility app that helps people <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/making-audio-more-accessible-two-new-apps/\">hear more clearly</a>, and now it\u2019s available on Android devices running Android 6.0 Marshmallow and above. Using machine learning, we sorted through thousands of publicly available hearing studies and data to understand how people hear in different environments and created a few simple controls.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Here\u2019s how it works: When you plug in your headphones and use Sound Amplifier, you can customize frequencies to augment important sound, like the voices of the people you are with, and filter out background noise. It can help you hear conversations in noisy restaurants more clearly, amplify the sound coming from TV at personalized frequency levels without bothering others, or boost the voices of presenters at a lecture.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>For some people, it may be hard to know when Sound Amplifier is detecting or enhancing sound. So we added an audio visualization feature that shows when sound is detected, helping you visualize the changes you\u2019re making to it. Like a volume number on your TV, you know how much the sound is boosted even if you can\u2019t hear it yet. There are a couple of new visual updates, too. You can launch the app directly from your phone\u2019s home screen instead of tapping into Accessibility settings, and with the reorganized the control settings, you can easily tap between boosting your sound or filtering out the background noise.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid\"><figure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"><img alt=\"Sound Amplifier v2\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Sound_Amplifier_V2.max-1000x1000.png\"/><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption \"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Caption: Sound Amplifier has a new look and feel with an audio visualization feature.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>Sound Amplifier is the latest step in our commitment to make audio clear and accessible for everyone.
