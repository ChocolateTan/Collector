<html><head></head><body><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>Small businesses make a big impact on our communities–creating jobs, treating customers like family, and often defining what makes a town unique. Over the years, we’ve built a range of tools to help these businesses use the web to grow and thrive. In 2018, our Search and Advertising tools helped create <a href="http://google.com/economicimpact">$335 billion in economic activity</a> for millions of businesses, website publishers, and nonprofits across the United States. These tools make it easier for small business owners to find and connect with customers and run their businesses. </p><br/><p>I’ve had the opportunity to get to know many small business owners and the challenges they face. Most of them tell me that they need help saving time at work, or that they need easy tools to help them promote their business. The internet has created new opportunities for small businesses, but it can be hard to know where to start.</p><br/><p>Today is <a href="https://www.un.org/en/events/smallbusinessday/">International Small Business Day</a>—and many of us are supporting small businesses in our communities by paying a special visit to a local coffee shop or neighborhood restaurant. For my team, we’re doing our part to help small business owners with the launch of <a href="http://google.com/smallbusiness">Google for Small Business</a>, a new Grow with Google initiative to help you find the right Google tools and services to reach your business goals. On this website you can find:</p><p></p><ul><li><p><b>Personalized plans:</b> Tell us your business name, answer a few questions about your business, and select a goal. You’ll then receive a step-by-step, tailored plan of recommended products to help you stand out online, reach more customers, and work more efficiently. The recommendations will include products to help with all three, but with a special focus on the goal that’s most important to you.</p></li><li><p><b>In-person workshops:</b> Locate free Grow with Google workshops happening near you for hands-on help.  </p></li><li><p><b>Latest news:</b> Stay updated on Google’s small business-focused tools and services.</p></li></ul><p></p><p></p></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><div class="article-module h-c-page"><div class="h-c-grid"><figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "><img alt="Google for Small Business website" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Without_Intro_Outro_2.gif"/></figure></div></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>Get started at <a href="http://google.com/smallbusiness">google.com/smallbusiness</a> today. </p><p><br/></p></div></div></body></html>

<html><head></head><body><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>When you’re searching for a song’s lyrics, often you’ll see an information box in Search that shows the lyrics on the page. This feature has been under scrutiny this week, so we wanted to explain how it works and where the lyrics come from.</p><h3>How lyrics appear in Search</h3><p>Lyrics can appear in information boxes and on Knowledge Panels in Search when you’re looking for songs or lyrics. While we do this to help you find that information quickly, we also ensure that the songwriters are paid for their creative work. To do that, we pay music publishers for the right to display lyrics, since they manage the rights to these lyrics on behalf of the songwriters.</p><h3>Where the lyrics text comes from</h3><p>Here’s something you might not know: music publishers often don’t have digital copies of the lyrics text. In these cases, we—like music streaming services and other companies—license the lyrics text from third parties.</p><br/><p>We do not crawl or scrape websites to source these lyrics. The lyrics that you see in information boxes on Search come directly from lyrics content providers, and they are updated automatically as we receive new lyrics and corrections on a regular basis.</p><br/><p>News reports this week suggested that one of our lyrics content providers is in a dispute with a lyrics site about where their written lyrics come from. We’ve asked our lyrics partner to investigate the issue to ensure that they’re following industry best practices in their approach. We always strive to uphold high standards of conduct for ourselves and from the partners we work with.</p><br/><p>To help make it clearer where the lyrics come from, we’ll soon include attribution to the third party providing the digital lyrics text. We will continue to take an approach that respects and compensates rights-holders, and ensures that music publishers and songwriters are paid for their work.</p><p><br/></p></div></div></body></html>

## <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/photos/simplifying-google-photos-and-google-drive/" target="_blank">2019-06-12 15:00:00 Changing how Google Drive and Google Photos work together</a>
<html><head></head><body><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>Many of you store your photos and videos on both Google Drive and Google Photos, which keeps them safe and easy to access. We’ve heard feedback that the connection between these services is confusing, so next month, we’re making some changes to simplify the experience across Drive and Photos.</p><p><b>Changes to automatic sync between Google Drive and Google Photos</b></p><p>Starting in July, new photos and videos from Drive won’t automatically show in Photos. Similarly, new photos and videos in Photos will not be added to the Photos folder in Drive. Photos and videos you delete in Drive will not be removed from Photos. Similarly, items you delete in Photos will not be removed from Drive. This change is designed to help prevent accidental deletion of items across products.</p><p> <b>New “Upload from Drive” feature in Google Photos</b></p><p>We’ve heard that many of you would like more granular control when copying photos and videos from Drive into Photos. So we’re bringing a new feature to <a href="http://photos.google.com">photos.google.com</a> called “Upload from Drive,” which lets you manually choose photos and videos from Drive, including “Shared with Me” items, to import into Photos. Once copied, these items are not connected between the two products. Since photos and videos will no longer sync across both products, items copied in Original Quality will count towards your storage quota in both Drive and Photos.</p><p> <b>Backup and Sync for Windows and Mac will continue to work</b></p><p>You’ll still be able to use <a href="https://photos.google.com/apps">Backup and Sync</a> on Windows or macOS to upload to both services in High Quality or Original Quality. As before, items uploaded in High Quality won’t count against your account storage quota, and items uploaded using Backup and Sync in Original Quality to both services will count only once towards your quota.</p><p> <b>Your existing photos and videos will stay in Google Drive and Google Photos</b></p><p>Any photos or videos from Drive in Photos that you have uploaded prior to this change will remain in Photos. If you have a “Google Photos” folder in Drive, it will remain in Drive, but will no longer update automatically.</p><p> Our goal with these changes is to simplify some features that caused confusion for our users, based on feedback and our own research. We’ll continue to look for more ways to help support Drive and Photos users going forward.</p><p> If you want to take a closer look at these new changes, please check out our <a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/9316089?p=blogpost_transitionarticle&amp;visit_id=636957989726780274-3529170745&amp;rd=1">guide</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>
