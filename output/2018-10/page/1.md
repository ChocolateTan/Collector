## [A new course to teach people about fairness in machine learning](https://www.blog.google/technology/ai/new-course-teach-people-about-fairness-machine-learning/)
2018-10-18 16:00:00
<html><head></head><body><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>In my undergraduate studies, I majored in philosophy with a focus on ethics, spending countless hours grappling with the notion of fairness: both how to define it and how to effect it in society. Little did I know then how critical these studies would be to my current work on the machine learning education team where I support efforts related to the responsible development and use of AI.</p><br/><p>As ML practitioners build, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models, they should keep fairness considerations (such as how different demographics of people will be affected by a model’s predictions) in the forefront of their minds. Additionally, they should proactively develop strategies to identify and ameliorate the effects of algorithmic bias.</p><br/><p>To help practitioners achieve these goals, Google’s engineering education and ML fairness teams developed a <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/fairness/video-lecture?utm_source=keyword-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=mle-outreach&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_content=mlcc-fairness">60-minute self-study training module on fairness</a>, which is now available publicly as part of our popular Machine Learning Crash Course (MLCC).</p></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><figure class="article-image--full article-module "><img alt="ML bias" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screen_Shot_2018-10-17_at_6.02.52_PM.max-1000x1000.png"/><figcaption class="article-image__caption h-c-page"><div class="rich-text"><p>The MLCC Fairness module explores how human biases affect data sets. For example, people asked to describe a photo of bananas may not remark on their color (“yellow bananas”) unless they perceive it as atypical.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>Students who complete this training will learn:</p><ul><li>Different types of human biases that can manifest in machine learning models via data<br/></li><li>How to identify potential areas of human bias in data before training a model<br/></li><li>Methods for evaluating a model’s predictions not just for overall performance, but also for bias</li></ul><p>In conjunction with the release of this new Fairness module, we’ve added more than a dozen new fairness entries to our Machine Learning Glossary (tagged with a scale icon in the right margin). These entries provide clear, concise definitions of the key fairness concepts discussed in our curriculum, designed to serve as a go-to reference for both beginners and experienced practitioners. We also hope these glossary entries will help further socialize fairness concerns within the ML community.</p><br/>We’re excited to share this module with you, and hope that it provides additional tools and frameworks that aid in building systems that are fair and inclusive for all.

## [Five reasons (and two colors) why we love the new Chromecast](https://www.blog.google/products/chromecast/five-reasons-and-two-colors-why-we-love-new-chromecast/)
2018-10-09 16:15:00
<html><head></head><body><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>We launched <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chromecast/heres-five-years-chromecast/">our first Chromecast in 2013</a> with the aim to make it easy to get your favorite content right from your phone to your TV. With thousands of compatible apps to cast from, people are tapping the Cast button more than ever. And since Chromecast, the Made by Google family of products has continued to grow, bringing the best of hardware, software and AI together. So for this <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chromecast/heres-five-years-chromecast/">fifth year of Chromecast</a>, we wanted to share five reasons we’re excited about our newest Chromecast:</p><br/><ol><li><p><b>Fits right in.</b>With a new design and two colors—Chalk and Charcoal—Chromecast blends in with your decor and the rest of the Made by Google family.</p></li><li><p><b>Same size, but even more powerful.</b>Thanks to a 15 percent improvement in hardware speed, our newest Chromecast supports smooth streaming in 1080p at 60 frames per second, giving you a more lifelike image. So when you’re watching the game, it will feel even more like you’re there.</p></li><li><p><b>Stream hands-free.</b> Chromecast and Google Home work seamlessly together. Just say what you want to watch from compatible services, like YouTube or Netflix, and control your TV just by asking. Try, “Hey Google, play Cobra Kai from YouTube,” or “Hey Google, play Lost in Space from Netflix.” (You’ll need a Netflix subscription to get started.)</p></li><li><p><b>More than a screen—it’s a canvas.</b>When you’re not streaming, you can personalize your TV with new <a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/keep-your-favorite-photos-date-live-albums/">Live Albums</a> from Google Photos. Enjoy a constantly updating stream of photos of the people and pets you care about and skip blurry ones and duplicates—all without lifting a finger. Plus, new photos will show up automatically on your TV.</p></li><li><p><b>Your tunes in every room.</b>Whether you’re listening to your favorites on YouTube Music or Spotify, there’s nothing better than hearing on all your speakers—including your high-quality speakers connected to your TV. Later this year, you'll be able to add Chromecast to speaker groups, so you can listen to your music in sync throughout the house.</p></li></ol><p>And, of course, Chromecast is still just $35. So it’s an affordable way to upgrade your TV at home or the perfect gift this upcoming holiday season for the streamer in your life.</p><p>The new Chromecast is available from <a href="https://g.co/3qtjha">the Google Store</a> starting today in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Great Britain, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, and the U.S., with even more countries to follow in 2019.</p></div></div></body></html>
