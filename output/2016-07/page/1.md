Today, over 70% of calls to emergency services come from mobile phones, but locating these mobile callers can be a major issue. Current emergency solutions rely on cell tower location (which can have a radius of up to several kilometers) or assisted GPS (which can fail indoors).<br/> <br/> Accurate emergency location can be the difference between life and death. In fact, the US Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/60001010065.pdf">estimates</a> “an improved location accuracy which results in reducing wireless E911 response time by one minute can result in saving over 10,000 lives annually”.<br/> <br/><p>To help address this issue, we created the Emergency Location Service in Android. This feature, when supported by your network, sends location from your phone to emergency services when you dial an emergency number. This uses the same location technologies available to apps on your phone, including Wi-Fi, GPS, and cell towers, to produce a more reliable emergency location both indoors and outdoors.</p>This feature is solely for the use of emergency service providers, and your precise location is never seen or handled by Google. It is sent from your handset to emergency services only when you explicitly place an emergency call, either directly or through your mobile network.<br/> <br/> Emergency Location Service is supported by over 99% of existing Android devices (version 2.3 out and upwards) through Google Play services. The service activates when supported by your mobile network operator or emergency infrastructure provider.<br/> <br/> Our service is already live today for people with Android phones in the UK and in Estonia. We’ve collaborated with several mobile network operators and emergency services to make this possible:<br/></div></div><div class="block-image_half_width"><div class="article-module h-c-page"><div class="h-c-grid"><figure class="article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 "><img alt="telecom logos" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/telecom_logos.max-1000x1000.png"/></figure></div></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>We look forward to making Android’s Emergency Location Service available internationally, and are actively engaging with more countries and operators to make this widely available.

There are emoji like these for men:<br/></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><figure class="article-image--full article-module "><img alt="7_14 Emoji.png" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/7_14_Emoji_hZQzi1Z.max-1000x1000.png"/></figure></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text">but with options like these for women:<br/></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><figure class="article-image--full article-module "><img alt="7_14 Emoji 2.png" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/7_14_Emoji_2_dNIt5W9.max-1000x1000.png"/></figure></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text">… the emoji representing women aren’t exactly, well, representative. So we've been working to make things better.<br/> <br/> In May, we <a href="http://unicode.org/L2/L2016/16160-emoji-professions.pdf">proposed</a> a set of new emoji to the Unicode Technical Committee that represent a wider range of professions for women (as well as men), and reflect the pivotal roles that women play in the world. Since then, we've worked closely with members of the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee to bring the proposal to life.<br/> <br/> Today, the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16181-gender-zwj-sequences.pdf">Unicode Emoji Subcommittee has agreed</a> to add 11 new professional emoji, in both male and female options and with all the skin tones. That’s more than 100 new emoji to choose from!<br/> <br/></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><figure class="article-image--full article-module "><img alt="7_14-Skintones.gif" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/7_14-Skintones.gif"/></figure></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><br/> Unicode is also adding male and female versions to 33 existing emoji. For example, you'll be able to pick both a female runner emoji and a male runner emoji, or a man or woman getting a haircut:<br/></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><figure class="article-image--full article-module "><img alt="gender.gif" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/gender.gif"/></figure></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text">These additions can be included in future versions of Android and other platforms—because Unicode helps make sure that people with different phones can send and receive the same emoji.<br/> <br/> These new emoji are one of <a href="http://google.com/diversity">several efforts</a> we’re making to better represent women in technology, and to connect girls with the education and resources they need to pursue careers in STEM. One such effort is Made with Code, which helps girls pursue and express their passions using computer science. Ahead of World Emoji Day this weekend, <a href="https://www.madewithcode.com/">Made with Code</a> is releasing a <a href="https://www.madewithcode.com/projects/emoji">new project</a> that teaches coding skills through the creation of emoji-inspired stickers.<br/></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><figure class="article-image--full article-module "><img alt="emoji_blockly_ex1.png" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/emoji_blockly_ex1.max-1000x1000.png"/></figure></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>We hope these updates help make emoji just a little more representative of the millions of people around the ? who use them.</p></div></div></body></html>
