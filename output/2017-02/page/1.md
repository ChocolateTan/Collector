<div style:"visibility: hidden;"><html><head></head><body><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>While traditional watches tell the time, <a href="http://www.android.com/wear">Android Wear</a> watches make the most of your time. In an instant, you can check when and where you’re meeting a friend, whether you’ll need an umbrella tonight, or how many minutes you’ve been active today—all without reaching for your phone. Today, we’re announcing Android Wear 2.0 to give you more informative watch faces, better workouts, new ways to use apps, more ways to stay in touch and on-the-go help from the Google Assistant. We’re also introducing two new watches that run Android Wear 2.0.</p></div></div><div class="block-image_half_width"><div class="article-module h-c-page"><div class="h-c-grid"><figure class="article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 "><img alt="Android Wear 2.0 Watch Face" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Android_Wear_20_Watch_Face.gif"/></figure></div></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><h3>More personalized, helpful watch faces</h3><p>You can now personalize your Android Wear always-on watch face with information and actions from your favorite apps. Simply glance at your wrist to check your next appointment, stock performance, progress on fitness goals, or whatever is important to you. A quick tap on your watch face lets you instantly order an Uber ride, start a workout, or get in touch with your significant other. Interested in different info throughout the day? Just swipe to switch your watch face as you go from the office to the gym to dinner with friends and home again.</p></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><h3>Better ways to work out</h3><p>Google Fit, the pre-installed fitness app on most Android Wear watches, now lets you track your pace, distance, calories burned and heart rate* as you’re walking, running or cycling. You can also measure weight-lifting reps, in addition to push-ups, sit-ups and squats. When you work out with a cellular-connected Android Wear watch, you can stay in touch with calls and messages, stream tunes from Google Play Music and still use your favorite apps right on your watch.</p><h3>New ways to use apps</h3><p>With Android Wear 2.0, you can choose which apps you want on your watch and download them directly from the new on-watch Google Play Store. If your watch has a cellular connection, you can make calls and use your watch apps no matter where your phone is. Whether you use an Android phone or iPhone, you’ll be able to use apps built for Android Wear 2.0, like AccuWeather, Android Pay*, Bring!, Foursquare, Google Fit, Google Messenger, Google Play Music, Lifesum, Robinhood, Runkeeper, Runtastic, Strava, Telegram, Uber and many more.</p><h3>More ways to respond to messages</h3><p>Now it’s easier than ever to read and respond to a message right from your watch. When you receive a message, you can expand the notification and tap to respond by dictating, typing or handwriting your answer, or drawing an emoji. Try it out on apps like Facebook Messenger, Glide, Google Messenger, Hangouts, Telegram or WhatsApp. Need to respond quickly and discreetly? Use Smart Reply, which instantly and intelligently suggests different responses based on the message you received.</p><h3>The Google Assistant on your wrist</h3><p>Android Wear 2.0 brings the <a href="http://assistant.google.com#wear">Google Assistant</a> to your wrist, so you can find answers and get things done—hands free. Ask your Google Assistant about the weather or remind yourself to bring an umbrella. Make a restaurant reservation or navigate to work. You can even update your shopping list right from your wrist. To ask for help, just hold down the power button on your watch or say “Ok Google." The Google Assistant is available in English and German on Android Wear and will be available in other languages in the coming months.<br/></p><h3>Introducing LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport</h3><p>The first watches with Android Wear 2.0 are the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport—both designed in collaboration with Google.</p><p><br/></p></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><figure class="article-image--full article-module "><img alt="LG Watch Style &amp; LG Watch Sport" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/LGWatchStyleSport.max-1000x1000.png"/></figure></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>The LG Watch Style is thin, light, beautiful to look at, and comfortable to wear.
