总结起来，好像APP启动速度优化就一句话：让系统在启动期间少做一些事。当然我们得先清楚工程里做的哪些事是在启动期间做的、对启动速度的影响有多大，然后case by case地分析工程代码，通过放到子线程、延迟加载、懒加载等方式让系统在启动期间更轻松些。...

<html><head></head><body><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>Accurately locating someone during an emergency call is critical for reducing response time and can be the difference between life and death. More than <a href="https://www.nena.org/page/911Statistics">80 percent of emergency calls</a> come from mobile phones, but locating these phones can be challenging as traditional emergency location technologies can fail indoors or have a radius that’s too big to be useful.</p><br/><p>In 2016, we <a href="https://www.blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/helping-emergency-services-find-you/">announced</a> Emergency Location Service (ELS) in Android. ELS provides a faster, more accurate location to emergency communications centers when an Android user places an emergency call, helping save lives by shortening emergency response times. It provides a more accurate location both indoors and outdoors by using a combination of GPS, Wi-Fi, mobile networks and sensors—the same high-accuracy location you see when using Google Maps.</p><br/>Over the last two years, we’ve been expanding ELS worldwide; it's now available in 14 countries and provides location to emergency centers for more than 140,000 calls per day. Today we’re announcing the launch of ELS in the U.S. with RapidSOS, T-Mobile and West, to bring more accurate location more quickly to emergency centers.</div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><figure class="article-image--full article-module "><img alt="android emergency location services" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Blog_Asset_ANDROID_Location_Services-B.max-1000x1000.png"/></figure></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><h2>How Emergency Location Services in Android works</h2><p>ELS is supported on 99 percent of Android devices (version 4.0 and above). The ELS service activates where it is supported by your wireless provider or emergency infrastructure provider. We partner with wireless providers and public safety organizations to activate ELS in a country. You don't need to install a separate app, update your OS, or have special hardware to benefit from more accurate location. The location is computed on the device and delivered directly to emergency providers—without passing through Google servers, and only when you explicitly call an emergency number.</p><h2>Bringing more accurate emergency location to the U.S.</h2><p>In partnership with emergency technology company RapidSOS, we provide ELS location directly to emergency communications centers through their secure, IP-based data platform. RapidSOS integrates with existing software at emergency centers in the U.S. to provide a faster, more accurate location with ELS. In testing the technology in the U.S., emergency centers have told us ELS has already helped save lives in their jurisdiction, decreasing the average uncertainty radius from 159 meters to 37 meters (from 522 feet to 121 feet). At the Collier County Sheriff's office in Florida, a caller who had given an incorrect address was able to be found thanks to ELS. And in Loudon County, TN, ELS helped emergency responders get to a non-English speaking caller who was struggling to communicate her address.</p><p>ELS is also available for Android users on T-Mobile in the U.S. If you’re on T-Mobile’s network and make a call to 911, your Android phone can send your location to the emergency center to help first responders locate you quickly. Wireless providers like T-Mobile have existing ways to share emergency locations with emergency centers, but this integration with ELS will help deliver higher accuracy locations faster than before.</p><p>Finally, we’ve already launched ELS in the U.S. Virgin Islands through a partnership with West and a regional wireless provider, Viya. West is an emergency technology company that works directly with wireless providers. For Android users on Viya, our integration with West allows your more accurate location to be delivered more quickly with ELS to emergency centers through existing channels by wireless providers.</p><h2>Helping users around the world</h2><p>As we've launched ELS around the world, we've heard about the impact that our more accurate location has made in critical, emergency situations. In Austria, a mountain biker in a remote, heavily forested area suffered a serious accident and called emergency services for help. The legacy emergency location systems provided a location with a radius of more than 900 meters (about half a mile), while ELS was able to provide a location within 12 meters (39 feet) to help first responders locate the biker.</p><p>In New Zealand, Fire and Emergency received a call from someone who had seen a fire while he was driving along a rural highway. The caller didn’t know where he was on the highway. Using ELS, Fire and Emergency New Zealand was able to locate the caller and the fire, and dispatch a crew to put the fire out.</p><p>As we continue to expand ELS in Android in the U.S. and to additional regions and countries, we’re grateful for the opportunity to provide assistance when our users need it most.

Giving parents the tools they need to make the choices that are right for their families is critical, and we take our role here very seriously. Last year we launched the <a href="https://google.com/familylink">Family Link app</a> to help parents stay in the loop while their kids are using Android devices. Family Link helps parents keep an eye on screen time, manage the apps their kids can use, and more. Over the coming days, we’ll make Family Link available to more families, on more devices, and in nearly every country in the world. </p><p><b>Family Link can now help parents with teens manage technology</b></p><p>Family Link originally launched for kids under-13, but we’ve heard overwhelmingly from parents that the app is still useful as their kids enter their teen years. This week, parents around the world will be able to use Family Link to supervise their teen’s existing Google Account for the first time (see <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409">applicable age for a teen in your country</a>). There are some differences when supervising a teen’s account with Family Link. For example, teens are free to turn off supervision if they choose to, but we let parents know. Ultimately, it’s up to each individual family to have a conversation and decide what’s right for them.</p><p></p><p><b>Better Chromebook support for kids and teens</b></p><p>The need for supervision doesn’t end with mobile devices. Now, Family Link is available for Chromebook for kids <i>and</i> teens, allowing parents to manage website restrictions and account settings for their child from their device. Soon, parents will also be able to set screen time limits and manage the apps their child can use on Chromebooks.</p><p><b>Continuing to grow together</b></p><p>With more parents in more places able to use Family Link, we want to hear your thoughts on how we’re doing. If you want to share your ideas with us, just open the Family Link app, click the menu in the top left corner and tap “Help and feedback.”</p></div></div></body></html>

One of the best ways to improve the performance for your site is to run site tests. But it can be a challenge to manage all of them. That’s especially true when you’re managing multiple experiments, juggling different schedules, and then analyzing all the data. That’s why today, we’re adding three features to Google Optimize to make it easier to manage and measure your experiments.</p></div></div><div class="block-paragraph_with_image"><div class="article-module h-c-page"><div class="h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap"><div class="uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3"><figure class="article-image--wrap-small "><img alt="Email Notifications" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/00Optimize_Email_Notifications.max-1000x1000.png"/></figure><div class="rich-text"><h3>1.

That way, you’ll know when experiments start, when they end, and what was the winning variation.  </p><p>Now, whenever you create a new experiment, you can choose to receive email notifications directly.

To help you do that, we’ve created <a href="https://support.google.com/optimize/answer/7364397#experiment-dimensions-in-analytics">a brand new dimension in Analytics</a>, “Experiment ID with Variant.” This dimension combines your Optimize Experiment ID with the specific variant of your site that users saw.
