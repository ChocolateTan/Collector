<html><head></head><body><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text">Today, we’ll begin rolling out Android 7.0 Nougat to Nexus devices. And with more ways to make Android your own, it’s by far our sweetest release yet.<br/><br/>We took a different approach to building and launching Nougat this year. For starters, we invited developers to take a sneak peek at Android N back in March, so they could bring their apps to the new platform earlier. And of course we asked you to help us come up with names for this year’s release, resulting in lots of great ideas, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xn9iq3lG_w">delicious unveiling</a> back in June.<br/><br/>Android Nougat reflects input from thousands of fans and developers all over the world. There are over 250 major features in Android Nougat, but we wanted to highlight a few of the features you’ve been most excited about.<p><br/></p><h3>More personal</h3>Providing more ways to customize your phone to fit your personality is kind of a big deal, and Android has been leading the way since day one (Homescreen widgets, anyone?). With Android Nougat, you’ll have even more ways to make your phone your own, including:<br/><ul><li>Expanded emoji: There are now over 1,500 different emoji built into Android, including 72 new ones, so go ahead: express yourself.</li></ul><p></p></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><figure class="article-image--full article-module "><img alt="Android - 08_22 - Nougat.jpg" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Android_-_08_22_-_Nougat.max-1000x1000.jpg"/></figure></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><ul><li>Quick Settings controls: Quick Settings gives you easy access to things like bluetooth, WiFi and the all-important flashlight. With Android Nougat, you can actually control what tiles go where, and move ‘em around to fit your needs.</li><li>Multi-locale support: Apps can tailor their content based on your locale settings. So if you speak multiple languages, for instance, then search engines can show results in each of those languages. </li></ul></div></div><div class="block-image_half_width"><div class="article-module h-c-page"><div class="h-c-grid"><figure class="article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 "><img alt="Android - 08_22 - Nougat2.png" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Android_-_08_22_-_Nougat2.max-1000x1000.png"/><figcaption class="article-image__caption "><div class="rich-text">Expanded emoji and Quick Settings controls</div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><h3>More productive</h3>Whether you’re responding to work emails or making plans with friends, Android Nougat helps you multitask with ease with new features like Multi-window, Direct reply, and Quick switch.<br/><ul><li>Multi-window: Run two apps side-by-side. The windows are resizable, too, by simply dragging the divider.</li><li>Direct Reply: Reply directly to notifications without having to open any app.</li><li>Quick Switch: Switch between your two most recently used apps by simply double tapping the Overview button.</li></ul><p></p></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><h3>More battery smarts</h3>Starting with the release of Android Marshmallow last year, we have been making the battery smarter. That’s why we made the Doze feature even dozier with Android Nougat. Your device can now drop into lower power usage when it’s getting jostled around in your pocket or bag while on the move.*</div></div><div class="block-image_half_width"><div class="article-module h-c-page"><div class="h-c-grid"><figure class="article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 "><img alt="Android - 08_22 - Nougat3.png" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Android_-_08_22_-_Nougat3.max-1000x1000.png"/><figcaption class="article-image__caption "><div class="rich-text">Split-screen</div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><h3></h3><p></p><p></p><h3>More immersive</h3><p>Android Nougat is designed with immersive experiences in mind—including support for VulkanTM (an advanced 3D rendering API) and Daydream (Google’s platform for mobile virtual reality).<br/></p><ul><li>VulkanTM: Games will now leap to life thanks to high-speed, next-generation graphics — all powered by your device’s multi-core processor.</li><li>Daydream: Android Nougat is ready to transport you to virtual worlds with Daydream-ready phones, headsets and controllers — all coming later this year.</li></ul><h3>More secure</h3>As always, Android is built with powerful layers of security and encryption to keep your private data private.
