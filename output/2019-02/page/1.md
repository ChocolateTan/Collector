<html><head></head><body><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>Android's mission has always been to work closely with a broad and open ecosystem of partners to push the boundaries of hardware and software, bringing new experiences and capabilities to your mobile device. Together with manufacturers, carriers, chipset makers and developers, we want to build mobile experiences that are both productive and helpful—whether that’s giving you new ways to explore the world, helping you stay on top of a busy day or providing the tools to maintain a healthy relationship with technology.</p><p>This week, we’re at MWC Barcelona to celebrate new milestones with our Android partners, from the latest flagship devices to their vision and strategy for 5G.  </p></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><h3>Foldables: Expanding the definition of smartphones</h3><p>We’re constantly evolving Android to support our partners in building devices in a variety of shapes and sizes. Last fall, we <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/11/unfolding-right-now-at-androiddevsummit.html">announced</a> that Android will power the emerging category of phones with screens that can bend and fold. Along with this trend comes new smartphone capabilities—for example, multitasking on a phone can become even easier; with more available, expanding screen area, you can watch a video on one side and take notes on the other. Tablets can be more portable, folding to easily fit into your pockets or purses.</p></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><figure class="article-image--full article-module "><img alt="Foldable1" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Android_MWC_Blog_Asset_Foldable_HVPDL1O.max-1000x1000.png"/></figure></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>This week, the world’s first foldable screen devices are launching on Android, with Samsung’s Galaxy Fold announced at Galaxy UNPACKED, and Huawei’s Mate X which was just announced earlier today here at MWC Barcelona. We look forward to seeing more Android-powered foldable devices from other manufacturers, and we'll continue to make improvements to the operating system for a smooth experience on these phones.</p></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><h3>Unlocking new ways to learn, communicate and be entertained with 5G</h3><p>As the industry progresses towards faster and better connectivity with new devices and chipsets, 5G will accelerate the potential of richer entertainment and communication experiences. Our partners like Samsung, Xiaomi, LG, Huawei, Qualcomm, Sony, HTC, OnePlus and Vivo are revealing their plans for 5G, including new devices launching later this year. We’re excited that Android is enabling the world’s first 5G smartphones, helping accelerate its adoption in 2019 and beyond.</p></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><figure class="article-image--full article-module "><img alt="5G" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Android_MWC_Blog_Asset_5G.max-1000x1000.png"/></figure></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><h3>Better mobile messaging for everyone</h3><p>To improve the standard messaging experience on Android, we’ve been <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/rcs/partnering-mobile-industry-connect-people-and-businesses-rcs/">working</a> with many of our partners, including Samsung, Huawei, America Movil, Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Telefonica, Telenor, and Vodafone to make RCS (Rich Communication Services) more widely available. Google has helped to launch RCS with partners in 24 countries, bringing enhanced features in your conversations like group chats, read receipts, and high quality media sharing. We will continue to work to bring better messaging to every Android user, across a broad range of devices and carriers.</p><h3>Delivering a software experience that is up-to-date and secure</h3><p>As we continue to see new mobile trends emerging on Android’s open platform, we also know people and businesses want more clarity and assurance that their smartphones have the latest software and security updates. Over the last year, we worked with partners to offer reliable smartphone experiences on Android for more people and business customers globally.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.android.com/one/">Android One</a> program represents a collaboration with manufacturers to bring devices that deliver its key attributes: faster access to the latest version of Android, regular security updates and a software design that’s intuitive and streamlined. Thanks to our partners—including Xiaomi, LG, Motorola and HMD Global—Android One activations grew 250 percent year over year. With the addition of the Nokia 9 PureView, Nokia 3.2, Nokia 4.2 and more, Android One will continue to bring people a consistent smartphone experience that’s fresh and secure.</p><p>To help businesses discover the best devices and services Android has to offer, the <a href="https://www.android.com/enterprise/recommended/">Android Enterprise Recommended</a> program has validated more than 80 devices that meet elevated enterprise requirements for hardware, software and security updates. Just a few days ago, we <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/android-enterprise/aer-msp/">expanded</a> the program to include Managed Service Providers, who are mobility experts equipped to help customers build and support their Android enterprise deployments.</p><p><a href="https://www.android.com/versions/go-edition/">Android (Go edition)</a>, an optimized version of Android tailored for smartphones with 1GB of RAM or less, has helped bring the power of computing to everyone by delivering a powerful, fast and secure experience specifically optimized for entry-level smartphones. Our <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/android/android-9-pie-go-edition-new-features-and-more-options-fall/">most recent release</a>, Android 9 Pie (Go edition), is powering the new Nokia 1 Plus and the BLU Vivo Go. Today, over 50 percent of entry-level Android devices are now activating with Go.</p><h3>Easier access to the power of AI on mobile</h3><p>Alongside our partners, we’ve also brought more AI capabilities to the mobile ecosystem. Last year, we took the first step in working with LG to launch a dedicated button for the <a href="https://assistant.google.com/platforms/phones/">Google Assistant</a> on its flagship devices to help people get things done on the go—whether it’s staying on top of your day or finding directions with just your voice.</p><p>This year, we’re  bringing the Google Assistant button to the full portfolio of new Android devices with LG and Nokia, including the LG G8 ThinQ and K40 and the Nokia 3.2 and 4.2. New phones from Xiaomi (including the Mi MIX 3 5G and Mi 9), TCL and Vivo (including the V15 Pro) will also launch with the Google Assistant button later this year. With these partnerships, we expect over 100 million devices to launch with a dedicated Google Assistant button.</p><p>And to support future AI-driven mobile experiences, we worked with manufacturers like <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2018/12/05/qualcomm-announces-new-flagship-snapdragon-855-mobile-platform-new-decade">Qualcomm</a> and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mediatek-expands-collaboration-with-google-to-bring-machine-learning-to-mid-market-smartphones-300796742.html">Mediatek</a> to bring support for Android’s Neural Networks API and ML Kit. This integration lets phone manufacturers and app developers build faster, smarter and smoother experiences on mobile. For example, LG adopted these technologies to bring <a href="https://lens.google.com/">Google Lens</a> suggestions into the camera app on the LG G8 ThinQ, allowing people to simply point the camera, and with a single tap, call or save a phone number on a takeout menu, send an email right from a flyer, or open an address in Google Maps.</p><h3>Extending Digital Wellbeing tools to more devices</h3><p>Last summer, <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/introducing-android-9-pie/">Android 9</a> introduced a set of new tools to help you achieve the balance with technology you might be looking for. Since the release, people have told us that getting better visibility into their habits has helped them take more control over their phone usage.</p><p>Today, Digital Wellbeing is expanding to more phones beyond Pixel and Android One, starting with the new Moto G7 family. We're working with partners to bring these features to even more phones, so more people can use them to strike a better balance and focus on what matters to them the most.</p><h3>AR brings Android Partner Walk to life</h3><p>Every year at MWC Barcelona, we offer the Android Partner Walk, where attendees have the chance to collect character pins from our partners across the show floor. This year we decided to bring those characters to life with augmented reality. If you’re at the show, you can see and collect 3D pins using the <a href="http://g.co/androidpartnerwalk">Android Partner Walk</a> app. This app is powered by ARCore, Google’s platform for AR experiences.</p><p>When it comes to Android, we're focused on improving smartphones in ways that help people in their day-to-day lives—and we couldn’t do this without our partners. We’re proud that Android is powering many of the most exciting trends that push what mobile is capable of, and we cannot wait to see them in the hands of people around the world.</p><br/></div></div></body></html>

2019-02-07 17:00:00
<html><head></head><body><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p><i>Editor's note: February 5 was Safer Internet Day, but we’ll be talking about it all week with a <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/safer-internet-week-2019/">collection of posts</a> from teams from across Google.</i></p><p><br/></p><p>Encryption is incredibly important. It underpins our digital security. Encryption encodes data so that it can only be read by individuals with a key. With encryption, you are in complete control of this key, and you can store sensitive information such as personal data securely.</p><p>But encryption isn’t always practical, since it would slow some computers, smartphones and other devices to the point of being unusable. That changes with Adiantum, which we are introducing today in the spirit of <a href="https://www.saferinternetday.org/">Safer Internet Day</a>.</p><p>Adiantum is a new form of encryption that we built specifically to run on phones and smart devices that don’t have the specialized hardware to use current methods to encrypt locally stored data efficiently. Adiantum is designed to run efficiently without that specialized hardware. This will make the next generation of devices more secure than their predecessors, and allow the next billion people coming online for the first time to do so safely. Adiantum will help secure our connected world by allowing everything from smart watches to internet-connected medical devices to encrypt sensitive data. (For more details about the ins and outs of Adiantum, check out the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/02/introducing-adiantum-encryption-for.html">security blog.</a>)</p><p>Our hope is that Adiantum will democratize encryption for all devices. Just like you wouldn’t buy a phone without text messaging, there will be no excuse for compromising security for the sake of device performance. Everyone should have privacy and security, regardless of their phone’s price tag.</p></div></div></body></html>

2019-02-04 14:00:00
<html><head></head><body><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>The World Health Organization estimates that by the year 2055, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deafness-and-hearing-loss">there will be 900 million people</a> with hearing loss. We believe in the power of technology to help break down barriers and make life a little easier for everyone. Today, we’re introducing two new apps for Android designed to help deaf and hard-of-hearing people: Live Transcribe and Sound Amplifier.</p><h3>Bringing captions to conversations with Live Transcribe</h3><p>Dimitri Kanevsky is a research scientist at Google who has worked on speech recognition and communications technology for the last 30 years. Through his work, Dimitri—who has been deaf since early childhood—has helped shape the accessibility technologies he relies on. One of them is CART: a service where a captioner virtually joins a meeting to listen and create a transcription of spoken dialogue, which then displays on a computer screen. Dimitri’s teammate, Chet Gnegy, saw the challenges Dimitri faced using CART: he always carried multiple devices, it was costly and each meeting required a lot of preparation. This meant Dimitri could only use CART for formal business meetings or events, and not everyday conversations.</p><p>That inspired Chet to work with the Accessibility team to build a tool that could reduce Dimitri’s effort spent preparing for conversations. We thought: What if we used cloud-based automatic speech recognition to display spoken words on a screen? A prototype was built and Googlers across a bunch of our offices—from Mountain View to Taipei—got involved. The result is Live Transcribe, an app that takes real-world speech and turns it into real-time captions using just the phone’s microphone.</p><p>Live Transcribe has the potential to give people who are deaf or hard of hearing greater independence in their everyday interactions. It brought Dimitri closer to his loved ones—he’s now able to easily communicate with his six-year-old twin granddaughters without help from other family members. We’ve heard similar feedback from partners at <a href="https://www.gallaudet.edu/">Gallaudet University</a>, the world’s premier university for deaf and hard of hearing people, who helped us design and validate that Live Transcribe met needs of their community.</p></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><div class="article-module h-c-page"><div class="h-c-grid"><figure class="article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 "><img alt="livetranscribe" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/press-01.max-1000x1000.png"/></figure></div></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>Live Transcribe is available in over 70 languages and dialects. It also enables two-way conversation via a type-back keyboard for users who can’t or don’t want to speak, and connects with external microphones to improve transcription accuracy. To use Live Transcribe, enable it in Accessibility Settings, then start Live Transcribe from the accessibility button on the navigation bar. Starting today, Live Transcribe will gradually rollout in a limited beta to users worldwide via the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.audio.hearing.visualization.accessibility.scribe&amp;hl=en_US">Play Store</a> and pre-installed on Pixel 3 devices. <a href="https://www.android.com/accessibility/live-transcribe">Sign up here</a> to be notified when it’s more widely available.</p><h3>Clarifying sound with Sound Amplifier</h3><p>Everyone can use a little audio boost from time to time, especially in situations where there’s a lot of background noise—like at a loud cafe or airport lounge. Today, we’re launching Sound Amplifier, which we announced at Google I/O last year.</p><p>With Sound Amplifier, audio is more clear and easier to hear. You can use Sound Amplifier on your Android smartphone with wired headphones to filter, augment and amplify the sounds in your environment. It works by increasing quiet sounds, while not over-boosting loud sounds. You can customize sound enhancement settings and apply noise reduction to minimize distracting background noise with simple sliders and toggles. </p></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><div class="article-module h-c-page"><div class="h-c-grid"><figure class="article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 "><img alt="sound amplifier" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/press-01_1.max-1000x1000.png"/></figure></div></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.accessibility.soundamplifier">Sound Amplifier</a> is available on the Play Store and supports Android 9 Pie or later phones and comes pre-installed on Pixel 3. With both Live Transcribe and Sound Amplifier, our goal is to help the hundreds of millions of people who are deaf or hard of hearing communicate more clearly.</p></div></div></body></html>
