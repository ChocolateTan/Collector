But as you scan the menu, you’re probably wondering, “What’s good?” Now Google Maps is making it easy to “dish-cover” a restaurant’s most crowd-pleasing meals with a new popular dishes feature.</p><p><b>Popular dishes from down the street and around the planet</b></p><p>Whether you’re craving a tea cocktail in Brooklyn or sampling Pacific Rim cuisine in London, Google Maps now highlights a restaurant’s most popular items on the menu, so you can place your order with confidence.</p><p>The popular dishes feature is powered by a machine learning algorithm that matches dish names, provided by Google Maps users, with relevant photos and reviews. This creates a handy arrangement of a restaurant’s most popular meals right at your fingertips in Google Maps.</p><p>Simply pull up a restaurant on Google Maps to find its popular dishes in the overview tab. Feeling extra peckish? Dive into the menu tab to scroll through all the most-talked about meals, and tap on a popular dish to explore reviews and photos. In a country where you can’t read the language? Maps will also translate the reviews for you too.  </p></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><div class="article-module h-c-page"><div class="h-c-grid"><figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "><img alt="Animation showing popular dishes feature on Google Maps" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/GSB_PopularDishes_v5.gif"/><figcaption class="article-image__caption "><div class="rich-text"><p>The new popular dishes feature makes it easier to discover a restaurant’s most talked-about meals.<br/></p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>At the end of the day, this feature is  made possible because of contributions from people around the world who want to help others using Google Maps.

<html><head></head><body><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>Smartphones are key to helping all of us get through our days, from getting directions to translating a word. But for people with disabilities, phones have the potential to do even more to connect people to information and help them perform everyday tasks. We want Android to work for all users, no matter their abilities. And on Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we’re taking another step toward this aim with updates to <a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/making-audio-more-accessible-two-new-apps/">Live Transcribe</a>, coming next month.</p><br/><p>Available on 1.8 billion Android devices, Live Transcribe helps bridge the connection between the deaf and the hearing via real-time, real-world transcriptions for everyday conversations. With this update, we’re building on our machine learning and speech recognition technology to add new capabilities.</p><br/><p>First, Live Transcribe will now show you sound events in addition to transcribing speech. You can see, for example, when a dog is barking or when someone is knocking on your door.  Seeing sound events allows you to be more immersed in the non-conversation realm of audio and helps you understand what is happening in the world. This is important to those who may not be able to hear non-speech audio cues such as clapping, laughter, music, applause, or the sound of a speeding vehicle whizzing by.</p><br/><p>Second, you’ll now be able to copy and save transcripts, stored locally on your device for three days. This is useful not only for those with deafness or hearing loss—it also helps those who might be using real-time transcriptions in other ways, such as those learning a language for the first time or even, secondarily, journalists capturing interviews or students taking lecture notes. We’ve also made the audio visualization indicator bigger, so that users can more easily see the background audio around them.</p></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><div class="article-module h-c-page"><div class="h-c-grid"><figure class="article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 "><img alt="New features of Live Transcribe" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/LT01_-_sound_events_-_copy_text.max-1000x1000.png"/><figcaption class="article-image__caption "><div class="rich-text"><p><i>Caption: See sound events, like whistling or a dog barking, in the bottom left corner of the updated Live Transcribe.</i></p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>With billions of active devices powered by Android, we’re humbled by the opportunity to build helpful tools that make the world’s information more accessible in the palm of everyone’s hand.

2019-05-14 17:00:00
<html><head></head><body><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>Google I/O is always exciting for me. It’s a great moment when we get to tell the world about a wide range of new products and features that can help everyone do more with technology. Because of how intertwined tech is with every aspect of our lives, how we balance its use with our wellbeing has to be front and center. So, as we did last year, we made time to discuss how our users can find a balance by using technology more intentionally (and that might mean using it <i>less</i>).</p><p>Last year, we announced <a href="https://wellbeing.google/?utm_source=keyword_dwb&amp;utm_medium=referral">our commitment to digital wellbeing</a>, a company-wide effort to help our users balance their technology use in a way that feels right for them. The idea has taken hold. A recent survey we commissioned found that 1 in 3 Americans have taken steps to improve their digital wellbeing in the last year, and more than 80 percent of them said this had a positive impact on their overall sense of wellbeing.<br/></p><p>It’s still early, but we’re already seeing that some of our initial Digital Wellbeing features have helped people take control of their tech use. For instance, app timers have helped people stick to their goals over 90 percent of the time, according to our internal data from March of this year, and people who use Wind Down had a 27 percent drop in nightly usage on average.<br/></p></div></div><div class="block-video"><div class="h-c-page h-c-page--mobile-full-bleed"><div class="h-c-grid"><div class="h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col-l--12 "><div class="article-module article-video "><figure><a class="h-c-video h-c-video--marquee" data-glue-modal-disabled-on-mobile="true" data-glue-modal-trigger="uni-modal-9O0_ubB49F0-" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9O0_ubB49F0"><img alt="Android Digital Wellbeing: Tools for balance" src="//img.youtube.com/vi/9O0_ubB49F0/maxresdefault.jpg"/><svg class="h-c-video__play h-c-icon h-c-icon--color-white" role="img"><use xlink:href="#mi-youtube-icon"></use></svg></a></figure></div></div></div></div><div class="h-c-modal--video" data-glue-modal="uni-modal-9O0_ubB49F0-" data-glue-modal-close-label="Close Dialog"><a class="glue-yt-video" data-glue-yt-video-autoplay="true" data-glue-yt-video-height="99%" data-glue-yt-video-vid="9O0_ubB49F0" data-glue-yt-video-width="100%" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9O0_ubB49F0" ng-cloak=""></a></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><h3>Coming to Android Q</h3><p>We know there’s much more we can be doing, which is why we were excited to announce a number of new tools and features at I/O last week. We’re making several improvements to existing features, such as giving you more visibility into the status of your app timers, and allowing Wind Down to be scheduled by day of the week. And, building on the success of app timers, we’re extending its functionality to Chrome on Android, which will let you to set time limits on specific websites. <br/></p><p>Our devices should help support our intentions throughout the day. Whether it’s work, school or family and friends that we want to focus on, our devices shouldn’t get in the way. Notifications are an important part of keeping you informed, but not all of them are urgent enough to divert your attention. Now you can choose to make some notifications ‘Gentle’. Gentle notifications won’t make noise, vibrate or appear on the lock screen but are always available if you want to browse.<br/></p><p>And we created Focus mode, which allows you to temporarily pause distracting apps with a single tap from Quick Settings. Finally, because many people want more positive encouragement, we’re adding the ability  to set a screen time goal with helpful nudges to stay on track.<br/><br/></p></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><div class="article-module h-c-page"><div class="h-c-grid"><figure class="article-image--small h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--2 h-c-grid__col--offset-5 "><img alt="AndroidQ_Focus Mode.gif" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/AndroidQ_Focus_Mode.gif"/></figure></div></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><h3>New features for families</h3><p>For parents, screen time is often a unique challenge; in fact, according to a <a href="http://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/fluent_digital_wellbeing_report_global.pdf">recent study</a> commissioned by Google, 67 percent of parents are concerned about the amount of time their kids spend on devices. People with kids tell us they love that Family Link lets them set daily screen time limits, but we know that nothing about parenting is black and white. We <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/families/evolution-of-family-link-parental-controls/">announced</a> last week that Family Link will roll out new features that enable parents to fine-tune these boundaries by setting app-specific time limits and awarding bonus screen time directly from their own device. (We hope this will also help provide a little balance to family dynamics.) <br/></p><p>But tools and features are just part of the solution; for families in particular, communication is key. So on <a href="https://wellbeing.google/?utm_source=keyword_dwb&amp;utm_medium=referral">wellbeing.google</a>, we now offer tips and advice from experts, including a conversation guide to help parents talk to their kids about technology use. <br/></p><p>We believe technology should improve life, not distract from it, so we’ve made a company-wide commitment to prioritize our users’ satisfaction over the amount of time they spend with our products, and our teams are designing with digital wellbeing as a core principle. We’re focused on improving lives—today and in the future—and digital wellbeing is one of the most important ways we’re working to make that happen. <br/></p></div></div></body></html>

2019-05-07 18:48:00
<html><head></head><body><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>Today, we welcomed thousands of people to I/O, our annual developer’s conference. It’s one of my favorite events of the year because it gives us a chance to show how we’re bringing Google’s mission to life through new technological breakthroughs and products.</p><p>Our mission to make information universally accessible and useful hasn’t changed over the past 21 years, but our approach has evolved over time. Google is no longer a company that just helps you find answers. Today, Google products also help you get stuff done, whether it’s finding the right words with Smart Compose in Gmail, or the fastest way home with Maps.</p><p>Simply put, our vision is to build a more helpful Google for everyone, no matter who you are, where you live, or what you’re hoping to accomplish. When we say helpful, we mean giving you the tools to increase your knowledge, success, health, and happiness. I’m excited to share some of the products and features we announced today that are bringing us closer to that goal.</p><h3>Helping you get better answers to your questions</h3><p>People turn to Google to ask billions of questions every day. But there’s still more we can do to help you find the information you need. Today, we announced that we’ll bring the popular Full Coverage feature from Google News to Search. Using machine learning, we’ll identify different points of a story—from a timeline of events to the key people involved—and surface a breadth of content including articles, tweets and even podcasts.</p><p>Sometimes the best way to understand new information is to see it. New features in Google Search and Google Lens use the camera, computer vision and augmented reality (AR) to provide visual answers to visual questions. And now we’re <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/helpful-new-visual-features-search-lens-io">bringing AR directly into Search</a>. If you’re searching for new shoes online, you can see shoes up close from different angles and even see how they go with your current wardrobe. You can also use Google Lens to get more information about what you’re seeing in the real world. So if you’re at a restaurant and point your camera at the menu, Google Lens will highlight which dishes are popular and show you pictures and reviews from people who have been there before. In GoogleGo, a search app for first-time smartphone users, Google Lens will read out loud the words you see, helping the millions of adults around the world who struggle to read everyday things like street signs or ATM instructions.</p></div></div><div class="block-video"><div class="h-c-page h-c-page--mobile-full-bleed"><div class="h-c-grid"><div class="h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col-l--12 "><div class="article-module article-video "><figure><a class="h-c-video h-c-video--marquee" data-glue-modal-disabled-on-mobile="true" data-glue-modal-trigger="uni-modal-ePwKgKp69GE-" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ePwKgKp69GE"><img alt="Google Lens: Urmila’s Story" src="//img.youtube.com/vi/ePwKgKp69GE/maxresdefault.jpg"/><svg class="h-c-video__play h-c-icon h-c-icon--color-white" role="img"><use xlink:href="#mi-youtube-icon"></use></svg></a><figcaption class="article-video__caption h-c-page"><p>Google Lens: Urmila’s Story</p></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div class="h-c-modal--video" data-glue-modal="uni-modal-ePwKgKp69GE-" data-glue-modal-close-label="Close Dialog"><a class="glue-yt-video" data-glue-yt-video-autoplay="true" data-glue-yt-video-height="99%" data-glue-yt-video-vid="ePwKgKp69GE" data-glue-yt-video-width="100%" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=ePwKgKp69GE" ng-cloak=""></a></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><h3>Helping to make your day easier</h3><p>Last year at I/O we introduced our Duplex technology, which can make a restaurant reservation through the Google Assistant by placing a phone call on your behalf. Now, we’re expanding Duplex beyond voice to help you get things done on the web. To start, we’re focusing on two specific tasks: booking rental cars and movie tickets. Using “Duplex on the Web,” the Assistant will automatically enter information, navigate a booking flow, and complete a purchase on your behalf. And with massive advances in deep learning, it’s now possible to bring much more accurate speech and natural language understanding to mobile devices—enabling the <a href="https://blog.google/products/assistant/next-generation-google-assistant-io">Google Assistant</a> to work faster for you.</p><p>We continue to believe that the biggest breakthroughs happen at the intersection of AI, software and hardware, and today we announced two Made by Google products: the new <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/io-pixel-3a">Pixel 3a</a> (and 3a XL), and the <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/hub-max-io">Google Nest Hub Max</a>. With Pixel 3a, we’re giving people the same features they love on more affordable hardware. Google Nest Hub Max brings the helpfulness of the Assistant to any room in your house, and much more.</p><h3>Building for everyone</h3><p>Building a more helpful Google is important, but it’s equally important to us that we are doing this for everyone. From our earliest days, Search has worked the same, whether you’re a professor at Stanford or a student in rural Indonesia. We extend this approach to developing technology responsibly, securely, and in a way that benefits all.</p><p>This is especially important in the development of AI. Through a new research approach called <a href="https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub47077">TCAV</a>—or testing with concept activation vectors—we’re working to address bias in machine learning and make models more interpretable. For example, TCAV could reveal if a model trained to detect images of “doctors” mistakenly assumed that being male was an important characteristic of being a doctor because there were more images of male doctors in the training data. We’ve <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tcav">open-sourced TCAV</a> so everyone can make their AI systems fairer and more interpretable, and we’ll be releasing more tools and open datasets soon.</p><p>Another way we’re building responsibly for everyone is by ensuring that our products are safe and private. We’re making a set of <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/privacy-everyone-io">privacy improvements</a> so that people have clear choices around their data. <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/">Google Account</a>, which provides a single view of your privacy control settings, will now be easily accessible in more products with one tap. Incognito mode is coming to Maps, which means you can search and navigate without linking this activity with your Google account, and new <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/safety-security/automatically-delete-data/">auto-delete controls</a> let you choose how long to save your data. We’re also making several security improvements on <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-q-io">Android Q</a>, and we’re building the protection of a security key right into the phone for two-step verification.</p><p>As we look ahead, we’re challenging the notion that products need more data to be more helpful. A new technique called federated learning allows us to train AI models and make products smarter without raw data ever leaving your device. With <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html">federated learning</a>, Gboard can learn new words like “zoodles” or “Targaryen” after thousands of people start using them, without us knowing what you’re typing. In the future, AI advancements will provide even more ways to make products more helpful with less data.</p><p>Building for everyone also means ensuring that everyone can access and enjoy our products, including people with disabilities. Today we introduced several products with new tools and accessibility features, including Live Caption, which can caption a conversation in a video, a podcast or one that’s happening in your home. In the future, <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/live-relay-phone-calls-io/">Live Relay</a> and <a href="http://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/impaired-speech-recognition">Euphonia</a> will help people who have trouble communicating verbally, whether because of a speech disorder or hearing loss.</p></div></div><div class="block-video"><div class="h-c-page h-c-page--mobile-full-bleed"><div class="h-c-grid"><div class="h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col-l--12 "><div class="article-module article-video "><figure><a class="h-c-video h-c-video--marquee" data-glue-modal-disabled-on-mobile="true" data-glue-modal-trigger="uni-modal-OAdegPmkK-o-" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=OAdegPmkK-o"><div class="article-video__aspect-image" style="background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Google_Euphonia.max-1000x1000.png);"><span class="h-u-visually-hidden">Project Euphonia: Helping everyone be better understood</span></div><svg class="h-c-video__play h-c-icon h-c-icon--color-white" role="img"><use xlink:href="#mi-youtube-icon"></use></svg></a><figcaption class="article-video__caption h-c-page"><p>Project Euphonia: Helping everyone be better understood</p></figcaption></figure></div></div></div></div><div class="h-c-modal--video" data-glue-modal="uni-modal-OAdegPmkK-o-" data-glue-modal-close-label="Close Dialog"><a class="glue-yt-video" data-glue-yt-video-autoplay="true" data-glue-yt-video-height="99%" data-glue-yt-video-vid="OAdegPmkK-o" data-glue-yt-video-width="100%" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=OAdegPmkK-o" ng-cloak=""></a></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>Developing products for people with disabilities often leads to advances that improve products for all of our users.

2019-05-07 18:00:00
<html><head></head><body><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p> This year, Android is reaching version 10 and operating on over 2.5 billion active devices. A lot has changed since version 1.0, back when smartphones were just an early idea. Now, they’re an integral tool in our lives—helping us stay in touch, organize our days or find a restaurant in a new place.</p><p>Looking ahead, we’re continuing to focus on working with partners to <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/shaping-future-mobile-android/">shape the future of mobile</a> and make smartphones even more helpful. As people carry their phones constantly and trust them with lots of personal information, we want to make sure they’re always in control of their data and how it’s shared. And as people spend more time on their devices, building tools to help them find balance with technology continues to be our priority. That’s why we’re focusing on three key areas for our next release, Android Q: innovation, security and privacy and digital wellbeing. <br/></p><h3>New mobile experiences</h3><p>Together with over 180 device makers, Android has been at the forefront of new mobile technologies. Many of them—like the first OLED displays, predictive typing, high density and large screens with edge-to-edge glass—have come to Android first. </p><p>This year, new industry trends like foldable phone displays and 5G are pushing the boundaries of what smartphones can do. Android Q is designed to support the potential of foldable devices—from multi-tasking to adapting to different screen dimensions as you unfold the phone. And as the first operating system to support 5G, Android Q offers app developers tools to build for faster connectivity, enhancing experiences like gaming and augmented reality.<br/></p></div></div><div class="block-video"><div class="h-c-page h-c-page--mobile-full-bleed"><div class="h-c-grid"><div class="h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col-l--12 "><div class="article-module article-video "><figure><a class="h-c-video h-c-video--marquee" data-glue-modal-disabled-on-mobile="true" data-glue-modal-trigger="uni-modal-FgXVd60f02o-" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FgXVd60f02o"><div class="article-video__aspect-image" style="background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Foldables_Keyframe.max-1000x1000.png);"><span class="h-u-visually-hidden">See how Asphalt 9 adapts screen dimensions as you unfold the phone, a feature Android Q was built to support.</span></div><svg class="h-c-video__play h-c-icon h-c-icon--color-white" role="img"><use xlink:href="#mi-youtube-icon"></use></svg></a></figure></div></div></div></div><div class="h-c-modal--video" data-glue-modal="uni-modal-FgXVd60f02o-" data-glue-modal-close-label="Close Dialog"><a class="glue-yt-video" data-glue-yt-video-autoplay="true" data-glue-yt-video-height="99%" data-glue-yt-video-vid="FgXVd60f02o" data-glue-yt-video-width="100%" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=FgXVd60f02o" ng-cloak=""></a></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>We’re also seeing many firsts in software driven by on-device machine learning. One of these features is Live Caption. For 466 million deaf and hard of hearing people around the world, captions are more than a convenience—they make content more accessible. We worked closely with the Deaf community to develop a feature that would improve access to digital media. With a single tap, Live Caption will automatically caption media that’s playing audio on your phone. Live Caption works with videos, podcasts and audio messages, across any app—even stuff you record yourself. As soon as speech is detected, captions will appear, without ever needing Wifi or cell phone data, and without any audio or captions leaving your phone.</p></div></div><div class="block-video"><div class="h-c-page h-c-page--mobile-full-bleed"><div class="h-c-grid"><div class="h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col-l--12 "><div class="article-module article-video "><figure><a class="h-c-video h-c-video--marquee" data-glue-modal-disabled-on-mobile="true" data-glue-modal-trigger="uni-modal-YL-8Xfx6S5o-" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=YL-8Xfx6S5o"><div class="article-video__aspect-image" style="background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Live_Caption_Keyframe.max-1000x1000.png);"><span class="h-u-visually-hidden">A video that gives background on the history of captioning.

Android has the most widely-deployed security and anti-malware service of any operating system today thanks to <a href="https://www.android.com/play-protect/">Google Play Protect</a>, which scans over 50 billion apps every day. </p><p>We’re doing even more in Android Q, with almost 50 new features and changes focused on security and privacy. For example, we created a dedicated Privacy section under Settings, where you’ll find important controls in one place. Under Settings, you’ll also find a new Location section that gives you more transparency and granular control over the location data you share with apps. You can now choose to share location data with apps only while they’re in use. Plus, you’ll receive reminders when an app has your location in the background, so you can decide whether or not to continue sharing. Android Q also provides protections for other sensitive device information, like serial numbers.</p><p>Finally, we're introducing a way for you to get the latest security and privacy updates, faster. With Android Q, we’ll update important OS components in the background, similar to the way we update apps. This means that you can get the latest security fixes, privacy enhancements and consistency improvements as soon as they’re available, without having to reboot your phone.</p><h3>Helping you find balance</h3><p>Since creating our set of Digital Wellbeing tools last year, we’ve heard that they’ve helped you take better control of your phone usage. In fact, app timers helped people stick to their goals over 90 percent of the time, and people who use Wind Down had a 27 percent drop in nightly phone usage.</p><p>This year, we’re going even further with new features like Focus mode, which is designed to help you focus without distraction. You can select the apps you find distracting—such as email or the news—and silence them until you come out of Focus mode. And to help children and families find a better balance with technology, we’re making <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/families/evolution-of-family-link-parental-controls/">Family Link part of every device</a> that has Digital Wellbeing (starting with Android Q), plus adding top-requested features like bonus time and the ability to set app-specific time limits.<br/></p></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><figure class="article-image--full article-module "><img alt="Phone screens showing new Family Link controls in Android Q." src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/top_level_parental_app_specific_limits_bon.max-1000x1000.jpg"/></figure></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><h3>Available in Beta today</h3><p>Android Q brings many more new features to your smartphone, from a new gesture-based navigation to Dark Theme (you asked, we listened!) to streaming media to hearing aids using Bluetooth LE. </p></div></div><div class="block-image_full_width"><div class="article-module h-c-page"><div class="h-c-grid"><figure class="article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 "><img alt="A grid of logos that demonstrates which devices and brands Android Q beta is available on, including Pixel, Sony, Nokia, Huawei and LG." src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/collage.max-1000x1000.png"/></figure></div></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>You can find some of these features today in <a href="https://developer.android.com/preview">Android Q Beta</a>, and thanks to Project Treble and our partners for their commitment to enable faster platform updates, Beta is available for 21 devices from 13 brands, including all Pixel phones.</p></div></div></body></html>

## <a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/live-relay-phone-calls-io/" target="_blank">Easier phone calls without voice or hearing</a>
2019-05-07 17:53:00
<html><head></head><body><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>Last year, I read a social media post from a young woman in Israel. She shared a story about a guy she was in a relationship with, who was deaf, struggling to fix the internet connection at their home. The internet service provider’s tech support had no way to communicate with him via text, email or chat, even though they knew he was deaf. She wrote about how important it was for him to feel independent and be empowered.</p><p>This got me thinking: How can we help people make and receive phone calls without having to speak or hear? This led to the creation of our research project, Live Relay.</p></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p>Live Relay uses on-device speech recognition and text-to-speech conversion to allow the phone to listen and speak on the users’ behalf while they type. By offering instant responses and predictive writing suggestions, Smart Reply and Smart Compose help make typing fast enough to hold a synchronous phone call.</p><p>Live Relay is running entirely on the device, keeping calls private. Because Live Relay is interacting with the other side via a regular phone call (no data required), the other side can even be a landline.</p><p>Of course, Live Relay would be helpful to anyone who can’t speak or hear during a call, and it may be particularly helpful to deaf and hard-of-hearing users, complementing existing solutions. In the U.S., for example, there are relay and real-time text (RTT) services available for the deaf and hard-of-hearing. These offer advantages in some situations, and our goal isn’t to replace these systems. Rather, we mean to complement them with Live Relay as an additional option for the contexts where it can help most, like handling an incoming call or  when the user prefers a fully automated system for privacy consideration.</p><p>We’re even more excited for Live Relay in the long term because we believe it can help all of our users. How many times have you gotten an important call but been unable to step out and chat? With Live Relay, you would be able to take that call anywhere, anytime with the option to type instead of talk. We are also exploring the integration of real-time translation capability, so that you could potentially call anyone in the world and communicate regardless of language barriers. This is the power of designing for accessibility first.</p><p>Live Relay is still in the research phase, but we look forward to the day it can give our users more and better ways to communicate—especially those who may be underserved by the options available today.</p><p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/googleaccess">@googleaccess</a> for continued updates, and contact the Disability Support team (<a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/answer/7641084?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">g.co/disabilitysupport</a>) with any feedback.</p></div></div></body></html>

The new interface is built to help you get on the road faster, show more useful information at a glance and simplify common tasks while driving. Buckle up, as we walk you through Android Auto’s new look.<br/></p></div></div><div class="block-image_carousel"><div class="h-c-page article-module"><div class="article-module glue-pagination h-c-carousel h-c-carousel--simple h-c-carousel--dark ng-cloak" data-glue-pagination-config="{cyclical: true}"><div class="h-c-carousel__wrap"><ul class="glue-carousel ng-cloak" data-glue-carousel-options="{pointerTypes: ['touch', 'mouse'], jump: true}"><li class="h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide"><figure><div class="article-carousel__slide-img" style="background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/boardwalk_allupview_carousel_1.max-2000x2000.png);"><span class="h-u-visually-hidden">boardwalk_allupview_maps_spotify widget.png</span></div><figcaption class="article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std"><div class="rich-text"><p>See turn-by-turn directions while controlling other apps on the same screen.</p></div></figcaption></figure></li><li class="h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide"><figure><div class="article-carousel__slide-img" style="background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Video_thumbnail_2.max-2000x2000.png);"><span class="h-u-visually-hidden">Hit the road with Android Auto</span></div><figcaption class="article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std"><div class="rich-text"><p>The new launcher introduces a familiar way to easily discover and start apps compatible with Android Auto.</p></div></figcaption></figure></li><li class="h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide"><figure><div class="article-carousel__slide-img" style="background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/boardwalk_allupview_carousel_3.max-2000x2000.png);"><span class="h-u-visually-hidden">boardwalk_allupview_media playback.png</span></div><figcaption class="article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std"><div class="rich-text"><p>A new dark theme blends in with modern automotive interiors, while incorporating the best of Google’s Material Design.</p></div></figcaption></figure></li><li class="h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide"><figure><div class="article-carousel__slide-img" style="background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/boardwalk_allupview_carousel_4_vwAR3DN.max-2000x2000.png);"><span class="h-u-visually-hidden">boardwalk_allupview_incoming call notification.png</span></div><figcaption class="article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std"><div class="rich-text"><p>Notifications for incoming phone calls and messages make it easy to stay connected.</p></div></figcaption></figure></li><li class="h-c-carousel__item article-carousel__slide"><figure><div class="article-carousel__slide-img" style="background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/boardwalk_allupview_carousel_5.max-2000x2000.png);"><span class="h-u-visually-hidden">boardwalk_allupview_notification center.png</span></div><figcaption class="article-carousel__caption h-c-copy h-u-mt-std"><div class="rich-text"><p>The new notification center shows recent messages and calls in a place that’s familiar and easy to access.</p></div></figcaption></figure></li></ul><div class="h-c-carousel__paginate glue-pagination-previous" data-glue-pagination-label="Previous" data-glue-pagination-update-model="false"><div class="h-c-carousel__paginate-wrap"><svg class="h-c-icon h-c-icon--keyboard-arrow-left" role="img"><use xlink:href="#mi-keyboard-arrow-right"></use></svg></div></div><div class="h-c-carousel__paginate glue-pagination-next" data-glue-pagination-label="Next" data-glue-pagination-update-model="false"><div class="h-c-carousel__paginate-wrap"><svg class="h-c-icon h-c-icon--keyboard-arrow-right" role="img"><use xlink:href="#mi-keyboard-arrow-right"></use></svg></div></div></div><div class="h-c-carousel__navigation"><div class="glue-pagination-page-list"></div></div></div></div></div><div class="block-paragraph"><div class="rich-text"><p></p><ul><li><b>Get on the road faster:</b> As soon as you start your car, Android Auto will continue playing your media and show your navigation app of choice.
